# Project 0 - Due 1/26/22
For Project 0, you will create an angular application that utilizes an external API

## Requirements
- Your code should be stored in git repository hosted in our github organization
- Use at least 1 external API to source data
    - you should get this data in real time via http(s)
- Should demonstrate ability to integrate that data into UI/UX

- Utilize Angular to create a frontend application
- Your app should have 3 or more components
- Your app should demonstrate usage of directives
- Your application should demonstrate usage of angular routing
- Your app should have some sort of user interaction element

### Not Requirements, just ideas
- granular components with nice flow of data between them
- using Web Storage API to persist some data
- some sort of authentication/authorization with route guard
    - hard coded admin login? using IDaaS such as OAuth or auth0?
- integrating with user's hardware (camera, mic, etc)

### Fun things to create in Angular
- Games
- Data Visualization (D3.js, canvasjs)
- Kanban board
-

## Presentation
P0 Presentation will happen on 1/26/23 in the morning (exact time TBD). The project should be in a working state, with the most current code pushed to the repository in github. Everyone will give a short presentation (~5 minutes) of their project to the cohort and it will include the following:
- The premise of the application (What does it do?)
- Feature description
- demo of the application

Take this presentation more as a presentation to stakeholders rather than the one to fellow developers. We want to see working features and what does that mean rather than deep dive into code.

## Tips
- KEEP THE SCOPE SMALL
    - You only have 1.5 weeks to create an application that should be demo ready. Start with a teeny tiny scope that feels like you can finish it in third the time. And still consider shaving it down even further. You can always add more later.
    - Don't hesitate to come by me for a sanity check

- Your application should be in a working state most of the time
    - Don't keep copy pasting code in hopes of working
    - This would be a good time to utilize branching 

- Remember the KISS principle
    - Don't over-engineer or overly complicate things. Have enough structure to complete what you need and some room for expansion but not too much more than that
    - This doesn't mean you should ditch all best practices and create one giant component for all your application.

- Ideally, you should code freeze the day before the presentation
    - This means no more edits to the code, no matter how minor it is. 
        - Not even CSS rules
            - Not even colors

- Commit and push often

- Practice your demo and presentation ahead of time.
    - Especially demo. Down to the data you will use.
    - Please avoid demoing your bugs if at all possible.
    - If bug happens in demo, don't panic, simply move on

- Don't talk down your project during the presentation
    - We are here to see what you've accomplished, not how close to the total collapse it really is.
