User Stories

- Users should be able to get location specific weather data
- users should be able to get temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, etc, data
- Users should be able to adjust how far of the forecast they want (from 1 day to 10days, etc?)
- Users can allow the application to automatically detect their location

- Users should be able to change the background based on weather
- Users should be able to enter either zipcode or lat/lng for weather
- Users should be able to view different icons/images for different weather


What are our MVP (minimum viable product) features?
- What is the minimum set of features for this to be able to be called a weather app?
- Get weather data based on location
	- Doesen't have to fancy, we can literally ask users to input their lat/lng to get us started
	- Some api's don't support zipcode/address based weather data, then it means, allowing users to use zip code is not a trival feature because we have to find another API that can translate the zipcode/address into lat/lngs

- Data should include temperature, humidity, precipication
	- This is making sure we know how to use the data we are getting from API

- We should be able to display the data to the user
	- This doesn't have to be very fancy
	- This can literally be some div's and some p's

Once you achieve MVP, it's time to refactor, iterate over and implement additional features/polish existing features as needed afterwards
